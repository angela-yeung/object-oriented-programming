# object-oriented-programming

Object-oriented programming is an approach to model real-world objects as software objects. Objects have properties associated with them and also behaviours or functions it can perform.

In this workbook, I attempt to model my 18 month old toddler as a software object (because I just can't get enough of her in the real world!) by associating properties like name and age as well as behaviours such as walking and talking.
